					"#![Spark Logo Tiny](https://files.training.databricks.com/images/105/logo_spark_tiny.png) Accessing Data in S3 Buckets\n",
					"\n",
					"## Learning Objectives\n",
					"\n",
					"By the end of this lessons, you should be able to:\n",
					"* Describe how IAM roles provide secure access to data in S3 buckets\n",
					"* Mount an S3 bucket to DBFS\n",
					"* Use s3a URLs to directly access buckets\n",
					"\n",
					"The [recently added SAML-backed IAM credential passthrough](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/07/17/how-databricks-iam-credential-passthrough-solves-common-data-authorization-problems.html) provides our most-secure approach to managing data access in large organizations. If a customer wishes to set this up, contact your Databricks representative for configuration details.\n",
					"\n",
					"In this notebook we will demonstrate using [cluster-mounted IAM roles](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/iam-roles.html#step-6-launch-a-cluster-with-the-s3-iam-role) to grant data access rights to all users with permission to access a cluster. Some considerations:\n",
					"\n",
					"### Security\n",
					"The main benefit of this system is that it is straightforwardly secure. As long as the admin team maps users to EC2 instances correctly, each user has access to the correct set of entitlements.\n",
					"\n",
					"### Attribution\n",
					"This system does not allow attribution to users. Because all users on a given EC2 instance share the same Instance Profile, cloud-native audit logs such as AWS CloudTrail can attribute accesses only to the instance, not to the user running code on the instance.\n",
					"\n",
					"### Ease of administration\n",
					"This system is easy to administer provided the number of users and entitlements remain small. However, administration becomes increasingly difficult as the organization scales: admins need to ensure that each user accesses only the EC2 instances with the correct Instance Profiles, which may require manual management if the Instance Profiles don’t map cleanly to policies in the admin’s identity management system (such as LDAP or Active Directory).\n",
					"\n",
					"### Efficiency\n",
					"This system requires a separate EC2 instance for each entitlement, which quickly becomes expensive as the organization’s permission model becomes more complex. If there are only a few users with a particular entitlement, that EC2 instance will either sit idle most of the day (increasing cost) or have to be stopped and started according to the work schedule of its users (increasing administrative overhead and slowing down users). Because Apache Spark™ distributes work across a cluster of instances that all require the same Instance Profile, the cost of an idle cluster can become quite large."
